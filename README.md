# Introduction

This is an overview of the Wildcard system. The Wildcard system uses a standard deck of cards to perform
necessary skill/ability checks during game-play instead of the traditional dice system. The Wildcard
focuses on simplicity, forgoing the more complex use of base stats (STR, DEX, CON, etc.) and instead
simply uses a list of skills and abilities ranked from 1 to 5.

## Characters

### Character Sheet

* Name

* Skills
> Name : Rating (1 - 5)

* Powers
> Name: Rating (1 - 5)

* Fate

* Wounds

* Dinero

* Equipment

* Complications

* Background

### Creation

Character creation works on a point-buy system. Characters start with 30 points. Skills and abilities
have a cost per rank determining how many points are needed to increase the rank of the skill or ability.
Skill values are defined in the skill list.

> Currently the best way to model powers without having to define an entire system was to use the
> existing rules and tools defined in the Mutants and Masterminds manual.

### Skills

A skill represents how well you can do something.

Notes on purchasing skills:

1. All skills start at rank 1
2. Each skill is generally categorized based on its usefulness.
3. Skills have a 5-rank limit

> A more general, useful or powerful skill will cost more per rank than a more specific or niche
> skill.

* **Wrangling** - How well you handle a rope, tie folks up, and lasso stuff.

### Abilities

Abilities represent more supernatural type of feats you can perform or specialized skills that were not covered in the standard skill list above.

Hucksters, Chosen (Christian/Catholic/Mormon/etc.), Shamans, Mad Scientists, Witches, and Witch
Doctors, to name a few, have developed abilities beyond the normal human, albeit mystical,
biological, scientific, or otherwise. Naturally, spending your time practicing your supernatural
abilities will be to the detriment of your more normal skills. Be careful not to spend ALL your
points here, now. Remember, an hombre can be pretty mean with nothing but his mundane self too,
so don't go thinking you need to take any high-falutin' supernatural abilities if it doesn't fit
well. There's something to be said about a good right hook.

Also keep in mind some abilities can have in-game drawbacks. Abilities with a vulgar execution
(i.e. tossing a fireball) must understand that doing so will likely draw the attention of
townsfolk, lawmen, and the government. While in some circles it is accepted to use these powers
openly, it is often seen or interpreted as witchcraft. Players should bear this in mind when
selecting powers and abilities and attempt to masquerade them in the trappings of reality. Mad
scientist types have a distinct advantage here. Consult your GM for more information.

Notes on purchasing abilities:

1. All skills start at rank 0
2. Determine cost per rank using powers from Mutants and Masterminds Powers
3. Add +1/rank to base M&M cost per rank since it ain't easy breaking reality. (i.e. a 1/rank M&M power becomes 2/rank. Also note you can bring a 1/rank M&M power back to 1/rank by taking a -1/rank power flaw.)
4. Abilities have a 5-rank limit, just as skills do.

## Core Mechanic

* To use a skill or ability, draw a number of cards equal to your ranks in the skill or power (ranked 1-5).

* Extra cards (up to 2) are drawn for favorable conditions. For instance, if you surprise the target, you have taken aim, prepared a plan of attack, etc.

** For unfavorable conditions on unopposed checks, the action's difficulty goes up.
** For unfavorable conditions on opposed checks, the opponent receives an extra card as a favorable condition.

* Each card drawn that is a 10, J, Q, K, or A is a success.
* If the action is not opposed by another character then the target number of successes is based on the attempted action's difficulty:

Number of successes needed based on difficulty:

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Difficulty</th>
    <th>Success Needed</th>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Normal</th>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Hard</th>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Impossible</th>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Probability of success based on number of cards drawn:

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Cards Drawn</th>
    <th>1+</th>
    <th>2+</th>
    <th>3+</th>

* If the action is an opposed test then the target number of successes is based on the successes drawn from the opposition's appropriate skill.

> If your successes are less than the opposed successes, the attempt fails.
>
> If your successes are equal to the opposed successes, the attempt succeeds.
>
> * If the action attempts to do damage and the successes are equal, then a single damage is done.
>
> If your successes are greater than the opposed successes, the attempt succeeds.
>
> * If the action attempts to do damage, the damage is equal to 1 + the difference in successes.

## Combat

Combat uses the above core mechanic of determining the effect of skills and powers. However,
there is an additional mechanic called the 'finale hand' that comes into play:

* Draw Initiative

Each player draws a number of cards equal their jumpiness. The player selects
one card to represent their initiative score and discards the rest. Initiative order proceeds
from Ace to 2. Players drawing initiative cards that are equal resolve the order based on suit
(Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs). If they suits are the same, they are considered to act at the
exact same time. Players add their chosen initiative card to a special 'finale hand'.

* Characters' Actions

Each player acts at their initiative order moving, using skills or
abilities, etc. After completing a skill/power check, the player must selects a card to add to
their finale hand and discard the others. The selection follows these rules:

* If there were successes, the player must choose a card from the success cards only.
* If there were no successes, the player chooses any card drawn.
* If the player REALLY wants a non-successful card, they can choose to fail their action and collect whatever card they wish from the draw.
* If a player performs no actions on their turn, they still draw one card to add to their finale hand.
After each player has acted, the order begins again.  This continues for four rounds.

* Fifth Round - At this point each character (player characters as well as the GM's NPC groups)
  should have 5 cards in their finale hand. The character or NPC group with the highest poker
  hand gains 'creative control', allowing them to write the story for the round. The level of
  control is based on the value of the poker hand compared to enemies' hand and must be
  negotiated with the GM.

* Next Level - At this point the action either ends or 'kicks it up a notch'. If the GM has more
  in store, each character draws their jumpiness skill and the finale hand starts again.


## Fate

Fate Chips exist in Deadlands and exist as a similar mechanic to that of Hero Points, Edge, etc.  Fate Chips should remain in the system and provide similar benefits:

* Add two additional cards to the skill check (not to exceed the two maximum)
* Buy one success
* Heal a wound
* Allows player to swap out a card for their initiative order

Fate Chips, may also have some effect on the outcome of the finale combat hand.

## Feats, Edges, Flaws, and Hindrances

They go by many names in many different systems. This is a list to give a character a little
something extra when they are out there wrestling cattle, trying to outdraw gunslingers, or
trying to bust out of jail. General Feats

Players are able to select **Talented**, **Inspired**, and **Gifted** for each individual skills.

* **Talented** – This feat allows the player to take one card from the associated skill check and put
it up their sleeve (place it to the side) to be used again for a later, similar skill check. The
card that is removed from the initial skill check is not counted towards completing the initial
skill check. Similar skill checks means: shooting the same target again, crafting another of the
same item, healing the same person again, smooth talking the same person, sneaking through the
same area, etc.

Also players cannot put a card up their sleeve during the same action where a card is played from up the sleeve.

**Inspired**

This feat allows the player to draw an additional card when an ace is played during the associated skill check.  This card is immediately added to the skill check.

**Gifted (Requires Talented and Inspired)**

This feat works the same as talented except the player is allowed to use the card on any check made by the skill.  This means: shooting a completely different target, crafting a completely different item, etc...


### Flaws

Players are encouraged to define a number of different flaws for their character. The flaws
should be used to help define or influence the characters action and do well to increase the
overall "cool" of the character. Flaws are awarded a number of points based on their detriment.
These points are returned back to the character so that they may be used for their other skills
and abilities. When creating flaws consult with the GM for the exact value of each flaw. Some
examples, borrowed heavily from Deadlands:

**Nightmares, Bad Luck, ... (2pt)**

When you close your eyelids you're tortured by the sins of your
past. These nightmares leave you a wreck in the morning. You begin the session with one less
Fate Chip.

**Wanted (1pt-3pt)**
You are wanted for a crime that you did or did not commit.  Depending on how immediate and severe the crime, determines the severity of the flaw.  Take into consideration the location, the severity of the crime, and the strength of those that are pursing the character.
